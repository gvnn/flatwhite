Flatwhite (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white)

Node.js REST API ONLY CMS... HTML, CSS, MVC?! No way, Jose!

	- nodeunit: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit
	
Database:

	MongoDb
	
		- MongoDb: http://www.mongodb.org/
		- node-mongodb-native: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native

	DB Whish list:

		- CouchDB
		- Redis?
		
The idea:

Flatwhite is a very simple CMS API. Developers can define the content item structure and categorize it associating tags to it... That's it!


Build modules:

Flatwhite allows you to write the modules that you like, it's all in the routing:

/:version([0-9]+)/:module([a-z]+)/:item([a-z0-9]+)?/:operation([a-z]+)?

the main function checks which module has to be called and loads the module's file in the modules folder, for example posting
a request to "/1/admin" will load the admin.js module. Modules must implement the "execute" method, called by the main process.

Database modules:

Flatwhite implements a very simple data abstraction layer. Similar to modules the "driver" has to be saved in the 
modules/data folder and has to implement:
	
	- "setup": method called at load
	- "collection": object that expose the operations available on the collection (add, delete, update, search)
