The idea
-------------

Flatwhite is a very simple CMS, without any GUI, only REST APIs... That's it!

  Version 1
  Provide basic authentication and basic CMS. A content item has only Title,
  Summary, Text. A content Item can have one or more Tags/Files.

  Version 2
  Optional custom fields for content items, related content. More Databases.

  Version x
  Is it really necessary?


Build modules
-------------

Flatwhite allows you to write all the modules that you like, it's all in the 
routing:

/:version([0-9]+)/:module([a-z]+)/:item([a-z0-9]+)?/:child([a-z]+)?

The main function checks which module has to be called and loads the module's
file, for example posting a request to "/1/admin" will load the admin.js
module. Modules must implement the "execute" method, called by the main
process.


Database modules
-------------

Flatwhite implements a very simple data abstraction layer. Similar to modules,
the "driver" has to be saved in the modules/data folder and has to implement
the "collection" object that expose the operations available on a specific
collection of items (add, get, remove, update, list, find, etc...)


Documentation
------------- 

Modules documentation files are in the docs folder. For more examples please
refer to the tests section.


Debug
-------------

Flatwhite uses by default the 8080 port, if you want to use node-inspector
this is a working command line:

$ node-inspector --web-port=8081  & node --debug flatwhite.js
